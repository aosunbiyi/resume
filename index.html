                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>I am an experienced web developer specializing in the WordPress CMS. While my core competency is backend, I am skilled on the frontend as well, and I dabble in DevOps. I&rsquo;m passionate about writing clean, maintainable, performant, and secure code. As a self-taught developer and lifelong learner, I am continuously working to improve my skills, and to learn new tools and techniques. I'm a believer in open source, and have contributed a number of plugins to the WordPress.org plugin repository, totaling over 10,000 active installs.</p>
